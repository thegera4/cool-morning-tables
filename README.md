## Cool Morning
This web application was created for Cool Morning, a small company based in Torreón, Coahuila, Mexico. The company offers multiple business lines focused on creating happy customer experiences, including breakfast and snack boxes as gifts, party arrangements, and more.

Cool Morning partnered with La Trattoria TRC, an Italian restaurant located in the same city, to create a unique experience that allows customers to book special tables designed for couples to enjoy a memorable time together. Additional items can also be included in the reservation.

This web application allows the user to book this special table and pay online for the reservation.
